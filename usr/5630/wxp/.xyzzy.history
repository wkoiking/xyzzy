# Hardware Architecture {#sec:Hardware}

## System Configuration for Whole Line 8

Refer to \"ROKU7600-93-1410402 System Configuration\" for the system configuration overview of whole Line 8.

## Mimic Panel

Mimic Panel consists of 7 x 3 70inch wall displays to display line overview and CCTV images.

### Wall Cube

* Model
    * DELTA DVS-7080R9IA

* Resolution
    * Full HD (1920 x 1080)

* Size
    * 70inch

### Wall Controller

* Model
    * DELTA Icon_Pro

* OS
    * Windows 7

* Redundant Power Supply
    * 100-240VAC

![Overview of Wall Controller](./png/catalog/Icon_Pro.png){#fig:OverviewOfWallController}

![Back-view of Wall Controller](./png/dimensions/Icon_Pro.png){#fig:BackviewOfWallController}

### Base Mount

The height of the base mount for line 8 shall be determined taking the height of base mount of line 7 in consideration.

### KVM Switch

* Model
    * Sanwa Supply SW-KVM2HDC

![Overview of KVM Switch](./png/catalog/SW-KVM2HDC.png){#fig:OverviewOfKVMSwitch}

### Typical Display Configuration

The applications to display at each cube is configurable with the mimic panel management software.
However, the ATS software is optimized for the following display configuration.
i.e., The software is provided with the line schematic overview MMI specially dedicated for 3 x 5 cubes.

* 3 x 5 cube is dedicated for line schematic (by default)
* 3 x 2 cube is dedicated for CCTV (by default)

### Redundancy Management

The each cube have the input from the redundant wall controller, i.e., each cube have the two display port.
The each cube uses the active input from the two input so that failure of the one wall controller is mitigated.

![Line Overview](./png/MMI/windows/Line_Overview/IWNR.png){#fig:LineOverview}

* The shape of the mouse pointer shall be as follows
    * When the hovering the curser at grabbable object (e.g., control panel's blank area)
        * ![](./png/MMI/icons/mouse_grabbable.png)
    * When grabbing the grabbable object (e.g., control panel's blank area)
        * ![](./png/MMI/icons/mouse_grabbed.png)
    * When hovering the curser on top of click-able object
        * ![](./png/MMI/icons/mouse_finger_point.png)
    * Other case
        * ![](./png/MMI/icons/mouse_plain_cursor.png)

* When there is no packet received from SC or OC, the indication corresponding to the default value defined shall be shown:
    * For SC, the default value is all 0
    * For OC, the default value is defined in \"list_of_conditions(ATS-OC).xlsx\"

* The only indication from the master system of OC or SC shall be displayed on Line Overview application
    * the master/slave status is checked by referring to \"SC Status\" or \"OC Status\" byte of the data header.
    * i.e., Line Overview application display indication of the packet only when last bit of the SC Status byte is 0.

* Basically, ATS do not check the interlocking condition by itself, however the ATS will not send the wasting command
  to CBI. e.g., when point is already in normal position, ATS will not send the \"point control to normal\" command.
  This is achieved by checking the current status of CBI and disabling the control buttons according to the status.
  The button which is not available at the moment is displayed differently from the available button so that user can
  easily distinguish when its available and not.

### Typical Display Configuration

The following 5 type of line overview is available to be displayed in Display Area.

* Overview of whole line
    * for traffic controller at OCC/BCC (for 3 monitor workstation)
    * horizontal scroll bar appear when this view is applied to 1 or 2 monitor workstation

* Overview of the workshop (at former depot location) and stabling yard (at Jasora Vihar Shaheen Bagh)
    * for the depot control workstation (for 3 monitor)

* Overview of each interlocking area
    * for the train control workstation (for 1 monitor)

* Overview of the whole line
    * for the mimic panel (70inch, 5x3 cubes)

These can be selected from View Chooser in Tool Bar.

The following illustrate the sample MMI of the application (Overview of whole line).

![Whole Line View](./png/MMI/windows/Line_Overview/Line_Overview.png){#fig:WholeLineView}

### Function {#sec:Func}

This section describes the function of Line Overview application.

#### Train Position Indication {#sec:TrainPositionIndication}

The train position is indicated by red color on the track.
Utilizing the CBTC train positioning information:

* ATS receives the position information of train as the chainage of front of train and the chainage of back of train.
* ATS shows the train occupation by indicating the track in-between the front and back with red color.
* Utilizing the CBTC train information, the train Icon with train ID or Rake ID is shown at the place of occupation.
    * When the train ID is assigned, the train ID is shown on the icon
    * when the train ID is not assigned, the rake ID is shown on the icon

* Train position indication at platform
    * ![](./png/MMI/icons/train_at_station.png)
    * Condition
        * \"P0 Stopped = 1\" or Front and Rear of the train is on the home track

* Train position indication at interstation
    * ![](./png/MMI/icons/train_at_interstation.png)
    * Condition
        * Otherwise

The train positioning is done by track section unit in case of CBTC failure.
i.e., When the SC of the corresponding zone failed, the train occupation is shown utilizing the track section information provided by corresponding OC for the zone.
      In this case the train icon and train ID will not be shown.

When ATS lost the tracking of train (either by no reception of the packet from SC or no reception of the train position information), the train icon will be remained at the position of the timing of disappearance.

The icon of the lost train is indicated as follows:

![](./png/MMI/icons/lost_train.png)

The information of the train is also kept at the timing of disappearance.

The icon can be manually deleted from Display Area by:

1. clicking the train icon
2. clicking the delete button form Description/Control Area

![Control Panel for Lost Train](./png/MMI/icons/lost_train_control_panel.png){#fig:LostTrainControlPanel}

##### Track Layout Rule for Line Overview

* The proportion of the track length on Line Overview does not represent the actual relative length of tracks
    * In order to optimize the layout of the Line Overview, the designer design the appropriate layout of tracks and
      its length on the Line Overview in ad hoc manner and reviewed by employer
    * Generally, the home track and turnout section is scaled larger compared to the interstation track etc

* The track section is divided into virtual blocks and the relative length of virtual blocks in one track represent the actual relative length of virtual block

* For the position of the point in Line Overview, following rule is applied
    * the relative length of \"one end of the track to the point\" and \"the other end of the track to the point\" reflect the actual relative length
    * the relative length of \"one end of the track to the signal\" and \"the other end of the track to the signal\" reflect the actual relative length

![Track Layout Rule for Turnout Section](./png/MMI/indication_layout_rule/Track_Layout_Rule_for_Turnout_Section.png){#fig:TrackLayoutRuleForTurnout}

![Track Layout Rule for Signal](./png/MMI/indication_layout_rule/Track_Layout_Rule_for_Signal.png){#fig:TrackLayoutRuleForSignal}

##### SC Occupation Indication Rule {#sec:OccupationIndicationRule}

* The SC send the chainage information of front of train and rear of train to ATS as the occupation range of the train
* ATS map the occupation range to the track of Line Overview such that
    * The relative length of \"one end of the track to the front of occupation\" and \"the other end of the track to the front of occupation\" maintains the actual length
    * The same apply to the rear of the occupation

![Occupation Indication Rule](./png/MMI/indication_layout_rule/Occupation_Indication_Rule.png){#fig:OccupationIndicationRule}

The following is the samples of the train occupation indication including:

* interstation,
* turnout section, and
* home track

#### Overlap Locking

In order to set the route with G aspect, the corresponding points in overlap section for the route must
be locked.

To achieve the point lock, overlap Locking Button is used.

overlap Locking is set by clicking the overlap Locking Button.

* overlap Locking Button
    * ![](./png/MMI/icons/overlap_locking_button.png)

The overlap locking can not be manually canceled.

The CBI cancel the overlap locking when the either of the following condition is met:

1. The track in advance of the signal is occupied
2. The train is stopped at P0
3. The home track is occupied for more than defined time

#### Automatic Route Setting

* Automatic Route Setting is done according to time table
* The route will be automatically controlled if all of the followings is satisfied:
    1. the train's preceded route in the time table is already controlled
    2. the departing time (minus Departure Offset) of the train in the train table is already passed and the train is in the home track (in case of departure signal),
    3. the train passed route control trigger (in case of passing train)
        * Refer to the following [@sec:RouteControlTrigerEdit] for the detail of the condition
    4. the route has the highest priority among the conflicting routes in the Junction Management Priority Queue
        * Refer to the following section [@sec:JunctionManagementEdit] for the detail of the condition
        * Of the two route whose starting signal is the same, the first route is always considered to have priority
    5. Tunnel limit is not exceeding
    6. Interstation stop is not detected
    7. ARS is not disabled for the route

The route remain in the junction management queue until the route is confirmed to be set.
Thus, ATS repeatedly control the route until it is set (with the 7s interval) when the conditions are met.

Note that

1. once the route is set, the route will not be canceled even when other conflicting route which has the higher priority get in the priority queue.
2. if the corresponding trip for the route is deleted by online timetable modification, the route in the queue will be also deleted
3. if the corresponding trip for the route is made \"Finised\" by reconciliation, the route in the queue will be also deleted


##### Route Control Trigger Edit {#sec:RouteControlTrigerEdit}

The trigger condition is edited by:

1. clicking corresponding signal, and
2. selecting the desired virtual block from the pull down of Route Control Trigger.

Note that the triggers are only configurable per one signal

The available trigering VB or trigering signal for each signal is described in \"ARS_data.xlsx\"

Note that if the S1 < S2 then

only the route trigers and Junction triger which satisfies the following shall be availalbe:

$$\\text{Route Triger of S1} < \\text{Junction Triger of S2} < \\text{Route Triger of S2}$$

where X < Y means X is located at the left of Y.

The same shall be hold for the opposite direction as well.

![Order of Trigers](./png/junction_management/order_of_trigers.png){#fig:OrderOfTriger}

##### Junction Management Edit {#sec:JunctionManagementEdit}

* The following junction management strategy is available.
    * prioritize particular route
        * in this mode, if there is more than one route in the junction management queue, the more prioritized route will be controlled first
    * prioritize particular train profile
        * in this mode, if there is more than one route in the junction management queue, the route for more prioritized train will be controlled first
    * prioritize first in
        * in this mode, if there is more than one route in the junction management queue, the route first get in to the queue will be controlled first
    * prioritize later train
        * in this mode, if there is more than one route in the junction management queue, the route for the train which is relatively later with respect to the schedule will be controlled first
    * prioritize order in schedule
        * in this mode, the route set first in the timetable will be always set first (Regardless of junction management trigger)
        * this is default mode for schedule regulation mode

The junction management strategy can be selected for each interlocking station by:

1. clicking IXL Area Setting Button in IXL Station Control Panel,
2. the IXL Area Setting Window will open
3. clicking the Junction Priority Mode button
4. the mode chooser will pop up, and
5. selecting the desired junction management strategy and its setting with the following MMIs

![Junction Priority Mode Setting](./png/MMI/windows/junction_priority_mode_setting.png){#fig:JunctionPriorityModeSetting}

For the route priority mode, the prioritized route is modified with the following MMI.

![Route Priority Setting](./png/MMI/windows/route_priority_setting.png){#fig:RoutePrioritySetting}

For the train profile priority mode, the prioritized train profile is modified with the following MMI.

![Train Profile Priority Setting](./png/MMI/windows/train_profile_priority_setting.png){#fig:TrainProfilePrioritySetting}

The timing when the routes are put into the junction management priority queue is edit-able as the follows.

Note that the junction management strategy is configurable per interlocking area.

###### Junction Management Trigger Edit

* except for the \"prioritize order in schedule\" and \"prioritize first train\" modes, the timing of when the route is put into the priority queue is configurable by
    * specifying the triggering virtual block, or
    * specifying the previous station departure

The trigger condition is edited by:

1. clicking corresponding signal, and
2. selecting the desired triggering virtual block from the pull down of Junction Management Trigger.

Note that the trigger is only configurable per one signal.

###### Example of Junction Management for Particular Scenario

#### Emergency Operation {#sec:Emergency}

* In such an occasion as there is a fire in the tunnel or train,
  it may be necessary for the operator to set the reverse route
  to keep the train away from the fire[^7].

[^7]: The signalling system can detect the train on fire through the fire detector on-board which is provided by Rolling Stock Contractor.
      The detection of the fire information is communicated from VATC to ATS Workstation
      via ATS Server so that the warning will be issued on the MMI of ATS Workstation.

* In such case, the user can enable emergency reverse operation mode by:
    1. clicking the Emergency Mode Toggle Button (which is placed per
       the neighboring pair of interlocking station)
    2. by the operation, ATS will issue emergency of the interstation section to CBI via SC

#### Automatic Train Regulation (ATR) {#sec:ATR}

ATR regulate the train movement automatically according to the timetable or headway.

What ATR component do:

* Automatic Assignment of Train ID, Next Station, Destination to Rake.
* Automatic Route Setting
* Log the actual performance of trains
* Estimate the arrival and departure time
* Adjust the timing of Automatic ATO Departure command i.e., adjust the dwell time
* Adjust the performance regime for Automatic ATO Departure command

There are following ATR modes:

1. Full Mode:
    * This is combination of Scheduled Mode and Constant Headway Mode
    * If the delay is more than specified value the mode is automatically degraded to constant headway mode

2. Timetable Mode:
    * Auto Adjust ON  (Auto Assignment + ARS + Automatic ATO Departure + Auto Adjust + Estimation&Logging)
    * Auto Adjust OFF (Auto Assignment + ARS + Automatic ATO Departure + Estimation&Logging)
    * Manual          (Auto Assignment + ARS + Estimation&Logging)
    
3. Constant Headway Mode:
    * Auto Adjust ON  (Auto Assignment + Cycle & Fleeting + Automatic ATO Departure + Auto Adjust + Estimation&Logging)
    * Auto Adjust OFF (Auto Assignment + Cycle & Fleeting + Automatic ATO Departure + Estimation&Logging)
    * Manual          (Auto Assignment + Cycle & Fleeting + Estimation&Logging)

4. Monitoring Only    (Estimation&Logging)
5. OFF

These modes can be switched by ATR Mode Chooser Button.

![ATR Mode Chooser](./png/MMI/icons/ATR_mode_chooser.png){#fig:ATRModeChooser}

The automatic train regulations are applied to whole line i.e., ATR is not configurable by the unit of interlocking area.

The following two measure is used for Automatic Adjustment:

1. Dwell time modification
    * If the deviation is less than the threshold, the dwell time is adjusted within the permissible deviation

2. Train performance regime modification
    * If the deviation is more than threshold, the train performance regime which
      minimize the difference between the estimated arriving time and the arriving time in timetable is used for the trip
      Since only finite number of the train performance regime is available, the dwell time modification is again applied
      after the train arrived at the next station

* The following two threshold is predefined for ATR algorithm
    1. Threshold for distinguishing the minor and major perturbation
        * If the deviation from the timetable is more than this value,
          the ATR algorithm utilize the performance regime modification in addition to dwell time modification
    2. The permissible deviation from dwell time (minimum dwell and maximum dwell time)
        * This specify the limit of the dwell time modification
    3. Spread unit
        * This specify the how delay distribution is applied
        * Refer to [@sec:AutoAdjustTimetable]
    4. Permissible delay for timetable mode
        * This parameter is used in the Full mode
        * If the delay is larger, then the regulation mode is automatically degraded to constant headway mode

The above three parameters are configured from \"Miscellaneous Setting Button\"

![ATR Parameter Setting](./png/MMI/windows/Miscellaneous_Setting_Window.png){#fig:ATRParameterSetting}

For the detailed ATR algorithm for each mode, refer to [@sec:ARSATR].

##### Timetable Regulation

In Timetable Regulation Mode the train is regulated by

* Automatic Route Setting according to timetable
* Automatically sending ATO Departure Command to train according to timetable

In case of delay, following automatic adjustment is performed to catch up to the schedule if the Auto Adjust is enabled.
Refer to [@sec:AutoAdjustTimetable] for the detail of the adjustment.

##### Headway Regulation

In Headway Regulation Mode the train is regulated by

* Fleeting Control
* Cycle Route Control
* Automatically sending ATO Departure Command periodically at each platform according to the designated headway

The short loop is automatically detected according to the cycle route setting.

In constant headway mode, according to the delay relative to proceeding train, the train performance regime and dwell time is dynamically adjusted if the Auto Adjust is enabled:

In case of headway of trains is not uniform, automatic adjustment is performed to level the headway of trains.
Refer to [@sec:AutoAdjustHeadway] for the detail of the adjustment.

##### Monitoring Only

ATR component only monitor the train performance and perform logging and estimation.
No automatic route setting, automatic ATO departure command nor auto adjustment is performed.

##### OFF

The ATR component is completely cut off so that no logging and estimation is performed.

##### Changeover between Timetable/Headway Regulation

* From Headway to Timetable Regulation
    * When train stops at departure platform of Janakpuri West Station,
      train number will be assigned to train automatically and
      operation mode will be changed to Timetable regulation train by train
      (ATS need to memorize the Headway Mode status per train)

![Headway to Timetable](./png/MMI/timetable/headway_to_timetable.png){#fig:HeadwayToTimetable}

* From Timetable to Headway
    * Operational headway is calculated automatically according to number of trains in Mainline
    * The following routes is automatically fleeted
    * The following cycle routes is automatically toggled on
    * Assignment of Train IDs to the trains is remained
        * Train ID must manually assigned or removed for new train from depot or train back to depot

* From Timetable Regulation to No Regulation
    * Assignment of Train IDs to the trains is immediately removed (Thus Rake ID will be shown on the train icon)

* From No Regulation to Timetable Regulation
    * Manual re-assignment of Train IDs is necessary if the current assignment of
      Train ID contradicts with the timetable

Note that by the change of regulation mode, fleeting will not be disabled automatically

##### Real Time Estimation of Arrival Time and Running Time {#sec:Estimation}

Real Time Estimation algorithm utilize the Running Time Matrix predefined for each train performance regime.

Refer to [@sec:RunningTimeMatrix] for the detail of running time matrix.

The running time between two station is estimated in real time based on the value defined on the running time matrix:

The count down of the arrival time start when the train departed from previous station.
By default, the time is count down from the value specified in the running time matrix (let it be $T$).
When TSR is applied in the section of the corresponding trip, the modified running time $T'$
is calculated by the following formula:

$$T' = T + (D1 / V1 - D1 / Va) + (D2 / V2 - D2 / Va) + ...$$

Where 

1. $D1, D2, ...$ is the length of the TSR section $TSR1, TSR2, ...$ and $V1, V2, ...$ is their speed limit.
2. $Va = D / T$
3. $D$ = Distance between the two station

Also, when the EB is applied to the train, the count down will halt until it is released.

##### Disabling the ATR of particular interlocking area

By Toggling off ATR Activation Button in Display Area,
automatic route setting by timetable and automatic sending of ATO departure command is disabled.

##### Special Regulation in ATR

When the ATR is enabled (the mode is set to Constant Headway Regulation or Timetable Regulation),
following special regulation is conducted:

When the preceding train is stopped before next station due to EB application and the following train does not start the previous station, the following train will be hold at the station (i.e, corresponding platform hold button is toggled on automatically).

Note that the platform hold will not be released automatically.

##### ATR Parameter Edit

[constant_headway_parameter_setting_dwell_time]: 

The setting of the ATR is edited by:

* Online Schedule Modification Button in Tool Bar, or

* Constant Headway Parameter Edit Button in Tool Bar

![Constant Headway Parameter Setting](./png/MMI/windows/constant_headway_parameter_setting.png){#fig:ConstantHeadwayParameterSetting}

![Dwell Time Setting](./png/MMI/windows/constant_headway_parameter_setting_dwell_time.png){#fig:DwellTimeSetting}

By clicking the Update Headway Button, the headway is automatically calculated based on the

* the number of trains in the main line
* the dwell time at each platform and,
* running time matrix

###### List of Buttons for Constant Headway Parameter Setting Window

* Update Headway Button
* Modify Dwell Button
* Print Button

#### Reverse Operation

Reverse Operation is only possible by manual route setting.

#### Online Timetable Modification

Timetable can be modified online by pushing the schedule mode setting button.
It will open the Timetable Editor in online mode with the following MMI:

![Timetable Management Online](./png/MMI/timetable/Timetable_Management_Online.png){#fig:TimetableManagementOnline}

Refer to [@sec:Timetable] for the detail of Timetable Editor.

In addition to the buttons available for the offline timetable editor, online timetable editor has
Reconciliation Button, refer to [@sec:Reconciliation] for the detail.

After the modification, the change is confirmed by committing it to the server from Menu -> File -> Commit the change to the server
Each commit is logged so that every online modification to the timetable is logged.

In online timetable modification, part of polyline regarding already finished route can not be modified nor deleted.
Thus, in case of online timetable modification, all the dwell modification is applied
in such a way that the local scope is implicitly set to not finished part of the polylines.

In case that the time passes after the modification and the route of modified part became \"finished\" the information
overrides the modification. Only \"Not Finished\" part of the modification remains valid as follows:

![Online Timetable Modification](./png/MMI/timetable/online_timetable_modification.png){#fig:OnlineTimetableModification}

More precisely, the new polyline made by the passing of time is created by concatenating the following two polyline:

1. polyline of finished part (orange polyline in the above figure)
    * Let end station of this polyline to be Station A
2. modifed polyline of which
    * the past part is deleted and furthermore the part of the polyline untill it reaches first dwell of Station A is deleted

the finished part of polyline (with its end dwell D) and modified polyline of which passed part is deleted and also for the future part the polyline is deleted till first dwell of station D)

Also, the polyline for Estimated Performance from the current time shall be shown on TDG and updated in real time.
The arrival and departure time of each dwell for the polyline for estimated performance is shown
when putting the mouse over the dwell.

The arrival time and departure time of actual performance is defined as follow

* Arrival Time
    * When ATS recieved the \"P0 stopped\" = 1 and \"train stopped\" = 1 at the corresponding track
* Departure Time
    * When \"train stopped\" became 0, after the arrival

When estimated polyline infringe on headway constraint, the event \"estimated polyline infringe on headway constraint\" shall be
generated by ATR and that conflict shall be highlighted in TDG.

Also when estimated polyline infringe on interchange matching constraint,
the event \"estimated polyline infringe on interchange matching constraint\" shall be
generated by ATR and that conflict shall be highlighted in TDG.

#### Control Transfer {#sec:ControlTransfer}

Note: The line schematic in this section does not represent the alignment of Delhi Line 8. These are used only for explanation.

ACR (Authority of Control Region) is authority for operator to control the corresponding region.
The control is taken or released by the unit of interlocking area.
Particularly, taking the control of discontinuous area is allowed.

Control for each interlocking area is exclusive and FCFS basis:

The operator whose profile have the ACR of the interlocking area can request
the control authority of the interlocking area by toggling on
the Control Toggle Button of the area (which will not be shown on the Display Area if the operator do not have the ACR).

If there is more than one operator who is requesting the control authority,
the first requested one will get the authority (i.e., FCFS).

To transfer the authority, the operator release the control authority by
toggling off the Control Toggle Button.

Then the authority will be transfered to the next operator who is requesting the control.
If absent Interlocking Area exists there shall be Alarm.

If the operator have at least one ACR and currently do not have any control authority, the message \"Please take control authority by clicking Control Toggle Button\" shall be shown on status bar.

The control authority is immediately released if the corresponding workstation failed.

The control of the interlocking area can be taken forcefully by \"Emergency Take Control Command\" by clicking Emergency Take Control Button.

The difference between ordinary \"Take Control Command\" to \"Emergency Take Control Command\" is
that \"Emergency Take Control Command\" do not require cooperative mechanism while the number
of the operation is logged as the safety related command.

The number of safety related command by ATS workstation is logged in server database, while the number of safety related command by VDU is logged locally by VDU itself.

Although, ACR of the each user profile is configurable, by default following ACR is defined for the default profiles:

: ACR of Default Profile {#tbl:ACROfDefaultProfile}

| Profile Name                      | ACR             |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Traffic Controller1 (OCC)         | JPW, IGDA, RKPM |
| Traffic Controller2 (OCC)         | IWNR, JLA, BTGD |
| Traffic Controller1 (BCC)         | JPW, IGDA, RKPM |
| Traffic Controller2 (BCC)         | IWNR, JLA, BTGD |
| Train Control Workstation (JPW)   | JPW             |
| Train Control Workstation (IGDA)  | IGDA            |
| Train Control Workstation (RKPM)  | RKPM            |
| Train Control Workstation (IWNR)  | IWNR            |
| Train Control Workstation (JLA)   | JLA             |
| Train Control Workstation (BTGD)  | BTGD            |
| Train Control Workstation (Depot) | KIKD, JSTB      |

Refer to interlocking table NX5337* for the detail of each area (such as exact location of boundary etc).

To realize seamless authority transfer from one operator to another
in case of regular takeover of the work, the user with the same profile
(as the profile of the currently logged-in user to a workstation concerned)
can takeover the position only by inputting the password.

Which is done by:

1. Clicking the Current Operator Profile Button,
2. The detail operator profile window will pop up,
3. Select the change the operator button
4. Inputting the password of the next operator

*TBA*

#### ACR of Inter-station

* If two neighboring interlocking area are operated by the different operator, the buttons at interlocking boundary (i.e., MBL, EM) shall be indicated for both operator* 
* If two neighboring interlocking area are operated by the same operator, then only one button for the operator is shown
* If signal S belongs to the interlocking area A, then the route R which originates from S also belongs to interlocking area A and
  the route R is manually controlled and released only from interlocking area A
* The trains at the section of inter-station shall be operated from only one of the two neighboring interlocking area at any time.
    * The border is as per the interlocking diagram
    * e.g., in the following if more than the half of the train occupation resides in T841C then the train is controlled from interlocking area C, while if more than the half of the train occupation resides in T801B the train is controlled from interlocking area B)

![ACR Same Operator Operates Neighboring Interlocking Area](./png/MMI/icons/ACR Same Operator Operates Neighboring Interlocking Area.png){#fig:SameOperator}

#### Inter-station Stop Detection {#sec:Inter-stationStopDetection}

ATS detects the inter-station stop when the following condition is satisfied for more than designated period of time:

* \"P0 stop\" = 0 and \"train stop\" = 1 and The train is not on home track

The period of time is configurable from \"Miscellaneous Setting Button\" with the following MMI:

![Inter-station Stop Detection Time Setting](./png/MMI/windows/Miscellaneous_Setting_Window.png){#fig:InterStationStopDetectionTimeSetting}

In case of inter-station stop or EB application at interstation, ATS refrain from sending automatic departure command to
next train to avoid bunching. This can be overridden by such as manual ATO departure command.

#### Tunnel Limit

The section between two ventilation fan in the tunnel is called ventilation block.
The ventilation fan is located at the both end of the platform, thus the ventilation block corresponds to the interstation section
in this project.

ATS refrain from sending automatic departure command when the number of trains in one ventilation block exceeds the designated
number of train (i.e., tunnel limit) if the train is departed.
Only One Tunnel limit is specified and the value is shared by every ventilation block. i.e., the tunnel limit is not configurable per ventilation block.
Tunnel limit can be overridden by such as manual ATO departure command.

The tunnel limit is configured from \"Miscellaneous Setting Button\" with the following MMI:

![Tunnel Limit Setting](./png/MMI/windows/Miscellaneous_Setting_Window.png){#fig:TunnelLimitSetting}

#### Congestion Mode

ATS send the congestion mode signal to TVS when the train is stopped at interstation for ventilation fan control.

Congestion Mode Detection can be enabled for each ventilation block with the following MMI:

![Congestion Mode Enabled Status Window](./png/MMI/windows/Congestion_Mode_Status_Window.png){#fig:CongestionModeStatusWindow}

ATS sends the congestion mode signal (Refer to ROKU7600-93-1410425-15C_Detail Interface Document (ATS-TVS).docx for the detail),
if the following condition is satisfied for more than designated period of time:

* \"P0 stop\" = 0 and \"train stop\" = 1 and The train is not on home track and,
* Congestion Mode Detection is enabled for that section.

The thresh hold is independently configurable from that of inter-station stop.

The congestion mode setting is configured from \"Miscellaneous Setting Button\" with the following MMI:

![Congestion Mode Detection Time Setting](./png/MMI/windows/Miscellaneous_Setting_Window.png){#fig:CongestionModeDetectionTimeSetting}

#### Positive Train Identification {#sec:PTI}

* ATS compares the Train ID submitted from On-board ATC with Train ID managed by itself.

* In case of mismatch, ATS issue alarm to operator and indicate the mismatch by blinking the Train ID on the train icon.

* In case ATR is Timetable Regulation, The train ID is automatically assigned to Rake and submitted from ATS to On-board ATC and is shown on DMI.

* Even when the driver manually input the train ID from DMI, if it contradict with train ID submitted by ATS,
  the DMI notify the mismatch to the driver and reject the input.

* In case ATR is Constant Headway Regulation, The train ID is automatically assigned to Rake and submitted from ATS to On-board ATC and is shown on DMI.

* Even when the driver manually input the train ID from DMI, if it contradict with train ID submitted by ATS,
  the DMI notify the mismatch to the driver and reject the input.

* In case ATR mode is Monitoring, ATS do not automatically assign Train ID to Rake. Train ID is manually assigned by operator and submitted from ATS to On-board ATC and is shown on DMI.

* Even when the driver manually input the train ID from DMI, if it contradict with train ID submitted by ATS,
  the DMI notify the mismatch to the driver and reject the input.

* In case ATR mode is OFF, no PTI is performed.

Thus, when ATS working normally and communication with On-board ATC is established,

1. PTI mismatch will not happen.
2. Train ID inputted from DMI will not be used 

#### Automatic Alternative Route Setting {#sec:TrackPriority}

For entry route for turnback tracks of interlocking station or depot stabling tracks, operator can assign alternative route to particular route.

The alternative route is automatically controlled according to this setting if the primary route is not available.

The alternative route is not applicable to passing train.

The alternative route is only applicable when the ATR/ARS mode is set to schedule adherence mode.

The priority is set as follows.

1. clicking IXL Area Setting Button in IXL Station Control Panel,
2. the IXL Area Setting Window will open
3. clicking the Automatic Alternative Route Setting Button
4. Automatic Alternative Route Setting Window will pop up, and
5. Configuring desired alternative route setting with the following MMIs

![Automatic Alternative Route Setting Window](./png/MMI/windows/Automatic_Alternative_Route_Setting_Window.png){#fig:AutomaticAlternativeRoute}

When the automatic alternative route is enabled, the following automatic route setting is performed:

* If the track is already occupied for the entry route, the alternative entry route is controlled
* If the track is already occupied for alternative entry route, its alternative is searched until there is no other alternative entry route
* When alternative route are chosen for entry route, corresponding departing route is automatically controlled according to the timetable
* The automatic alternative route setting will not performed when the route is controlled manually
* The automatic alternative route setting can be utilized when creating the timetable, i.e., when adding the new trip to the timetable, if the track is already occupied for the route, alternative route is chosen

#### Change of Ends of Train {#sec:ChangeOfTrainEnds}

On-board ATC detects the change of ends according to the direction of the route set by itself.
(ATS does not directly send the change of end request)

#### Depot Operation

For depot operation following modes are available

* Constant Dispatching Mode
    * By designating the headway and the number of train, trains are automatically dispatched to mainline
    * The maintenance day, priority of track is considered when selecting the train to be dispatched
* Automatic Parking Mode
    * Train came to transition track will be automatically guided to stabling track according to priority of track
* Schedule Mode
    * The train will be automatically controlled according to schedule
    * Refer to [@sec:DepotTimetable] for the detail
* Manual Mode
    * Train are controlled manually

Before the dispatching to mainline,  static test of train is automatically conducted at stabling track.
If the failure is detected by the tests, the following is conducted according to the operation mode:

* Constant Dispatching Mode
    * The train is skipped and next prioritized train is automatically dispatched
* Schedule Mode
    * The train will not be dispatched
    * To dispatch alternative train, the online depot timetable modification is necessary
* Manual Mode
    * The train can be dispatched according to the manual control of train

#### Logging of Safety Related Commands {#sec:SaftyCommandLog}

The following safety related commands are logged and the number of these operation is displayed on display area of
depot view, stabling yard view and interlocking area view

* Emergency Route setting and cancellation
    * Number of Emergency Route Setting and Cancellation
* Emergency Point operation
    * Number of Manual point authorization
* Emergency Take Control
    * Number of compulsory acquisition of ACR
* Unblocking operations
    * Number of Point Block
    * Number of Signal Block
    * Number of Maintenance Block
    * Number of Route Block

These counter information database is prepared per user, i.e., if user operated point unblocking, the point unblocking
counter for the user will be incremented while the counter for other user will not.

The counter is reset only when the counter reset operation is conducted from Account Management.

![Safety Related Command Counters](./png/MMI/icons/Counters.png){#fig:Counters}

* In VDU mode, these information is stored in local database while in ATS mode, these information is stored in ATS Servers.

### Definition of Timetable {#sec:DefinitionOfTimetable}

A Timetable specifies the operation of trains for a day in mainline.

A Timetable is stored in a file.

Timetable consists of Polylines:

* A Polyline specifies the operation of a train for the day in mainline
* A Polyline consists of series of Trips
    * A Trip consists of
        * Departing Platform
        * Destination Platform
        * Departing Time
        * Arriving Time
        * In Service/Out of Service
        * Crew ID

The starting time of a polyline is a time of the departing time of the first trip of the polyline.

The end time of a polyline is a time of arriving time of the last trip of the polyline.

The starting time of timetable is the minimum of the starting times of polylines consisting the timetable.

The running time(Trip A) =  Arriving Time(Trip A) - Departing Time(Trip A) 

For the neighboring two Trips A and B of a Polyline, the dwell of between the two trip is defined as:

* Dwell
    * Destination Platform(Trip A)
    * Departing Platform(Trip B)
    * Dwell Time (= Starting Time(Trip B) - End Time(Trip A))

The components of a timetable is illustrated in the following figure.

#### Type of Timetable

The timetable can be categorized in the followings,

* Timetable in the local storage
* Timetable assigned to calender
    * Future Timetable
    * Timetable being executed (Online Timetable)
        * Original for the day
        * Modified Timetable of the day
    * Past Timetable
        * Original for the day
        * Modified Timetable of the day
        * Polylines indicating the track of actual train operation
 
##### Timetable in Local Storage

Timetable created by the Timetable Editor can be saved in the local storage as a file.

##### Timetable Assigned to Calender

A timetable is assigned for the operation of a particular day.
The timetable assigned to a particular day is uploaded to the Timetable Calender Database of the server.

Refer to [@sec:SetTimetableToTheCalendar] for the detailed MMI for the assignment.

When the timetable which extended to the following day is assigned to a particular day in the calender,
The timetable is assigned so that the starting time of the timetable is in the day:

e.g., When Timetable A is assigned to 16/1/2014,

$$16/1/2014 00:00  <= starting time(Timetable A) < 16/1/2014 24:00$$

is satisfied.

Note that a timetable can be continued to the next day.

The trains is operated the same way according to the following two timetable, while the former one uses the two file
and the latter uses one file.

![timetable In A Day](./png/MMI/timetable/timetable_in_a_day.png){#fig:TimetableInADay}

![timetable Two Separate Day](./png/MMI/timetable/timetable_two_separate_day.png){#fig:TimetableTwoSeparateDay}

###### Future Timetable

The timetable assigned to a particular day is saved to the database which to be executed when the day comes.
The future timetable can be modified and re-assigned to the calendar.

###### Timetable being executed

The timetable which is assigned to a particular day is loaded to the main memory of the server
at the starting time of the timetable of the day, and the ATS/ATR is conducted according to the timetable.

The timetable can be modified online by clicking Online Schedule Edit Button.

Even when the timetable is modified online, the original one is kept for the performance analysis.

###### Past Timetable

Once the operation of the timetable is finished, the timetable is attached with the operation record and stored in the Timetable Calender Database.
The data stored to the database includes:

* Original Timetable
* Record of Modified Timetables while the execution
* Polylines Indicating the Track of Actual Train Operation
* ATP commands/signals the train has encountered
* Other information necessary for the generation of the statistic
    * Refer to [@sec:GenerationOfStatistic] for the detail

### Running Time Matrix Editor {#sec:RunningTimeMatrix}

[Running_Time_Matrix_Editor_Turnback_Time_Table]: 

Running Time Matrix and Turnback Time List can be edited by Running Time Matrix Editor from Menu -> Setting -> Open Running Time Matrix Editor

* This editor is for setting the running time of trips between every two stations and turnback
* Refer to \"running_time_matrix.xlsx\" for the format of running time matrix

* The values set by this editor is used as the default running time when creating the timetable
* Also it is used as the default running time for real time running time calculation for ATR

* The running time matrix is prepared for each of the train performance regime, namely,
    * A maximum train performance regime;
    * Full coasting regime;
    * Energy Saving regime;
    * 5% coasting performance regime;
    * 8% coasting performance regime.

The following is the MMI of Running Time Matrix Editor:

### Creating New Timetable --- Scaffolding

The New Timetable can be scaffold-ed by specifying the following parameter for every Time Block.

* the start time of the Time Block
* the end time of the Time Block
* headway or number of trains of the Time Block

The following is the example of the input format:

: Input of Timetable Scaffolding {#tbl:Scaffolding}

| No | Start Time | End Time | Num of Train | Headway | 
|----|------------|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1  | 5:00       | 6:30     | 6            | 15min   |
| 2  | 6:30       | 9:00     | 18           | 5min    |
| 3  | 9:00       | 17:00    | 9            | 10min   |
| 4  | 17:00      | 20:00    | 18           | 5min    |
| 5  | 20:00      | 23:00    | 9            | 10min   |
| 6  | 23:00      | 25:00    | 6            | 15min   |

Note:

* When two Time Block A and B are adjacent, the end time of A equals the start time of B
* The Running Time Matrix need to be predefined before the scaffolding of the time table.
* In the scaffold-ed Timetable with the above input, the following schedule of the trains are automatically calculated,
    * the new train from the depot due to the decrease of the headway
    * the redundant train which go back to depot according to the increase of the headway
* For the resulting polylines, Train ID shall be assigned from 01, 02 ... in order.
* There shall be no conflict of regarding the routes by the automatic creation of timetable while there could be conflict regarding the headway

#### Timetable Scaffolding Algorithm

The input to the algorithm is the list of time blocks (example is in the preceding section).

The output is the timetable which conforms to the input.

The depot insertion and deletion is automatically calculated for the timetable.

The following codes express the algorithm `makeDia`.

~~~{#lst:MainAlgorithm .haskell}
makeDia :: [Seed] -> LocalTime -> Dia
makeDia seeds endTime = foldl' appendDia [] (seeds ++ [(endTime, 0)])

appendDia :: Dia -> Seed -> Dia
appendDia dia (lt, n')
 | n >= n' = appendD dia (lt, n')
 | n <  n' = appendI dia (lt, n')
 where n = length $ filter (not . isEnded lt) dia
~~~

: Main Algorithm

##### Insertion Algorithm

The when the train increases (e.g., transition from row No 1 to No 2 in the above table) the following algorithm is used.

Consider 6 train is running at first as row No 1 of example input.

Consider new polylines starting from 6:30. The number of the polyline is 18 in the example input.

Match the 6 train with 18 polyline.

For remaining 12 polyline, the train is inserted from the depot (thus the head of polyline is deleted untill depot).

The following codes express the train insertion algorithm `appendI`.

~~~{#lst:InsertionAlgorithm .haskell}
appendI :: Dia -> Seed -> Dia
appendI dia (lt, n') = ended ++ matched ++ map (dropWhile (not . isDepot)) rest
 where (ended, os) = partition (isEnded lt) dia
       (matched, rest) = appendI' lt os xs
       xs = makeTrainsFromWithPhase lt lt n'

appendI' :: LocalTime -> Dia -> Dia -> (Dia, Dia)
appendI' lt [] xs =  ([], xs)
appendI' lt (o:os) xs =  (o':ls, rs)
 where (o', xs') = findAndCatI lt o xs
       (ls, rs) = appendI' lt os xs'

findAndCatI :: LocalTime -> PolyLine -> Dia -> (PolyLine, Dia)
findAndCatI lt o xs = (newPolyLine, xs')
 where (Just x, xs') = spanMinimumBy (stationArrivingTime lt station) xs
       newPolyLine   = takeWhile ((<= stationArrivingTime lt station o) . view _3) o
                    ++ dropWhile ((<= stationArrivingTime lt station x) . view _3) x
       station       = nextStation lt o
~~~

: Insertion Algorithm

##### Deletion Algorithm

The when the train decreases (e.g., transition from row No 2 to No 3 in the above table) the following algorithm is used.

Consider 18 train is running at first as row No 2 of example input.

Consider new polylines starting from 9:00. The number of the polyline is 9 in the example input.

Match the 18 train with 9 polyline.

The remained 9 trains is deleted when they passed the depot.

The following codes express the train deletion algorithm `appendD`.

~~~{#lst:DeletionAlgorithm .haskell}
appendD :: Dia -> Seed -> Dia
appendD dia (lt, n') = ended ++ matched ++ map (takeTill (liftM2 (||) (not . isDepot) ((<= lt) . view _3))) rest
 where (ended, os) = partition (isEnded lt) dia
       (matched, rest) = appendD' lt os xs
       xs = makeTrainsFromWithPhase lt' lt n'
       lt' = maximum $ map (recentlyDepotDepartedTime lt) os
       recentlyDepotDepartedTime :: LocalTime -> PolyLine -> LocalTime
       recentlyDepotDepartedTime lt o = view _3 $ fromJust $ find isDepot $ mTail $ reverse $ takeWhile ((<= lt) . view _3) o
        where mTail
                  | atStation depotName Up lt o || atStation depotName Down lt o = id
                  | otherwise = tail

isDepot :: (StationName, Direction, LocalTime, Int) -> Bool
isDepot (stn, dir, lt, pos) = stn == depotName

appendD' :: LocalTime -> Dia -> Dia -> (Dia, Dia)
appendD' lt os [] =  ([], os)
appendD' lt os (x:xs) =  (x':ls, rs)
 where (x', os') = findAndCatD lt x os

#### Headway Constraint Table Editor

Headway Constraint Table can be edited by Headway Constraint Table Editor from Menu -> Setting -> Open Headway Constraint Editor

Headway Constrain Table is used for timetable verification.

Following is the MMI of the headway constraint table editor:

![Headway Constraint Table Editor Chasing_Headway](./png/MMI/windows/Headway_Constraint_Table_Editor_Chasing_Headway.png){#fig:ChasingHeadwayMMI}

![Headway Constraint Table Editor Crossing_Headway](./png/MMI/windows/Headway_Constraint_Table_Editor_Crossing_Headway.png){#fig:CrossingHeadwayMMI}

Following is available from the menu.

* Menu
    * View
        * Chasing Headway Table
        * Crossing Headway Table
    * File
        * Save (Local)
        * Save As (Local)
        * Open
        * Use This Constraint for Timetable Verification

#### Timetable Compilation and Verification Algorithm

#### Timetable Compilation

The timetable made by timetable management is made of polylines.

Each polyline consists of series of trips, thus the timetable is of the form:

~~~
Train1: Trip11, Trip12, ...
Train2: Trip21, Trip22, ...
Train3: Trip31, Trip32, ...
~~~

where

* Trip$ij$ is the $j$th trip of the Train$i$
* for every Trip$ij$, $departingTime(trip)$ and $arrivingTime(trip)$ is defined.

These trips are translated into the routes so that the timetable is translated into the form:

~~~
Train1: Route11, Route12, ...
Train2: Route21, Route22, ...
Train3: Route31, Route32, ...
~~~

where

* Route$ij$ is the $j$th route of the Train$j$
* for every departure route, $departingTime(trip)$ is defined.

In the timetable verification algorith, described in the following section, precedence between
two routes of the different train is added and finally the timetable is translated into the partially ordered graph such as:

![Partially Ordered Graph](./png/MMI/timetable/partially_ordered_graph.png){#fig:PartiallyOrderedGraph}

where arrow between two routes indicates the precedence between the two.

This form is used for the execution of ARS by ATR component.

Preceded route need to be finised before the control of the following route.
However the precedence between two routes of different train is ignored except for the \"prioritize order in schedule\" mode.

#### Timetable Verification

First check that the neighboring dwell of non-interlocking station satisfy the chasing headway constraint.

Second check the interlocking station:

For each track, check that the neighboring dwell satisfy the chasing headway constraint.

Finally, check the crossing headway at each interlocking station:

Let $D$ = all the dwells of the interlocking station

Following properties are defined for dwell $d$:

$departureTime(d)$

$arrivingTime(d)$

$departureRoute(d)$

$arrivingRoute(d)$

let $(t_1, r_1), (t_2, r_2), ...$ be the sorting of $\\{(arrivingTime(d), arrivingRoute(d))| d \\in D\\} \\cup \\{(arrivingTime(d), arrivingRoute(d))| d \\in D\\}$ by comparing the first element of the tuple.

* For all $i = 1, 2, ...$
* let $Q = \\{r : r \\text{ conflicts with } r_i\\}$
    * For all $j = 1, 2, ...$ untill $Q /= []$
        * check if $r_i$ and $r_{i+j}$'s crossing headway constraint is satisfied by
          comparing $t_{i+j} - t_i$ to the entry of $r_i$ and $r_{i+j}$ in headway constraint table
        * (add the edge $(r_i, r_{i+j})$ to the partially ordered graph)
        * let $Q = Q \\setminus r_{i+j}$

### Depot Timetable {#sec:DepotTimetable}

The depot timetable specify the management of the rolling stocks at stabling yard and depot.

The following figure shows the sample of the depot timetable of stabling yard.

![Depot Timetable(Only Stabling Yard)](./png/MMI/timetable/depot_timetable(only_stabling_yard).png){#fig:DepotTimetableMMI}

The basic operation for the timetable editing is the same as the mainline timetable editing (both off-line and online).
Refer to [@sec:TDGEdit] for the detail of the operation.

This timetable is used when the ATR mode for depot is set to Schedule Mode.

Following importing function of Train ID and Rake ID is available.

* import train ID of mainline timetable of the day(for dispatching)
    * If the mainline timetable of the day is already defined, the train ID of the mainline can be imported to depot timetable
* import rake ID from mainline timetable of the day(for parking)
    * If the mainline timetable of the day is already defined and the rake is assigned to train, rake ID of the mainline can be imported to depot timetable
* import rake ID and train position from current status
    * From current status, initial position of the rakes of the depot timetable can be imported

![Importing Train ID for Dispatching](./png/MMI/timetable/importing_train_ID_for_dispatching.png){#fig:TimetableImporting}

Since the depot and mainline is controlled by the same system, the matching of depot and mainline timetable is checked
at the time of timetable submission to database (or timetable verification).
Thus, the system continuously track the train to and from depot and the transfer of Train ID, Crew ID etc is not necessary.

### Performance Monitoring {#sec:PerformanceMonitoring}

By selecting the past day from the calendar window, the timetable accompanied by the actual performance is downloaded from the server.
The user can analyze the performance of the particular day operation.

Also after downloading the data from the server,
the timetable accompanied by the actual performance can be saved to the local Disc as a file from Menu -> Save (Local)

Also, from the menu bar of the calendar window, various kind of statistics
can be generated automatically.

After the day is selected, the Past Timetable of the day will be shown.
the MMI of the Past Timetable is similar to Future Timetable with the following plot line in the TDG:

* Scheduled Timetable
    * Original for the day
    * Modified Timetables
* Actual Performance
* Estimated Performance (for the designated time)
    * The arrival and departure time of each dwell shall be displayed for this polyline
    * For this polyline, the real time estimation described on [@sec:Estimation] is used
    * For this polyline, dwell defined in schedule or constant headway setting is used

![Performance Monitoring](./png/MMI/windows/Performance_Monitoring.png){#fig:PerformanceMonitoring}

These plot line can be hidden/shown according to the corresponding check box.

The following remark can be displayed (or added) along with the TDG of the Past Timetable:

1. The logged events (which is selected by designating the particular filter, refer to [@sec:EventMonitor] for the setting of event filter)
    * The event shown on TDG is automatically determined prioritizing the one with higher alarm level
2. Any text remarks inputted by the operator

* Export to CSV Button (in the Timetable Area)
    * ![](./png/MMI/icons/pencil_and_paper_button.png)
* Detail of the Scheduled Timetables Button (in the Tool Bar)
    * ![](./png/MMI/icons/spectacle_button.png)
* Add Text Remark Button (in the Tool Bar)
    * ![](./png/MMI/icons/pencil_button.png)

When the Detail of the Scheduled Button is pushed, the following window pop up for the selection of the scheduled timetable and setting their line color to be displayed to TDG.

## Alarm Browsing Application {#sec:ABA}

The Alarm Browsing Application is an application for real time alarm monitoring with the following MMI:

![Alarm Browsing Application](./png/MMI/windows/Alarm_Browsing_Application.png){#fig:AlarmBrowsingApplication}

* Alarm is the event that require acknowledgment by the operator
    * Technically, the event whose event level is more than 5 is treated as alarm
* When some alarm is raised, it is shown blinking until it is acknowledged (i.e., once the alarm is acknowledged, the alarm is no longer blink but remain in the display)
* In conjunction with the display of alarm incoming alarms of the higher priority levels is accompanied by an audible tone which will also cease once the alarm is acknowledged.
* For the assignment of color and audible tone to the alarm, refer to [@sec:EventPriorityEditor]
* Audible alarm can be muted from Mute Audible Alarm Button
* Maximum 500 alarms are shown in ABA. If the number of alarms received exceeds 500 alarms then the unacknowledged alarms is cleared in FIFO manner.
  Unacknowledge alarms remain until it is acknowledged

The concept of ACR is also applicable to Alarm Browsing Application:

* ACR of alarm acknowledgment specify which alarm the operator can acknowledge
    * e.g., if the operator have ACR of IXL1 and IXL3, then only the alarms related to IXL1 or IXL3 will be shown on ABA.

* ACR of alarm monitoring specify which alarm the operator can see
    * e.g., if the operator have ACR of IXL1 and IXL3, then only the alarms related to IXL1 or IXL3 will be shown on ABA.

The event is generated and processed as follows:

1. Event occurs, i.e., the leader server generates the event and push the event to the queue of every server
2. The alarm information is sent to workstation for display update

Note: the non-acknowledged alarm stay in the queue (non-acknowledged alarm is not submitted to the event log database even when the time for database submission comes).

1. Workstation acknowledgment occur
2. Workstation send the acknowledgment information to leader server
3. Leader server generates the event and push the event to the queue of every server
4. The acknowledgment event is sent to workstation for display update

When alarm browsing application is launched, following is conducted:

1. When alarm browsing application is launched
2. workstation request the alarm information to leader server
3. the leader server send non-acknowledged alarms stored in the queue to workstation for display update

Thus, alarm browsing application display the unacknowledged alarms and alarms occurred after it launched

The event displayed in the event monitor is filtered by specifying the event filter with the following MMI.

![Event Filter Setting](./png/MMI/windows/event_filter_setting.png){#fig:EventFilterSetting}

In event filter setting, one can specify the past period of time.
In that case the events occurred in the period (which satisfy the other filter condition) will be fetched from the event log database and shown on MMI.
Maximum 500 events can be fetched from the database and if there is more than 500 event that satisfy the filter condition,
the newer 500 events among them are fetched from database.

In event filter setting, one can also specify the current time instead of the past period of time.
In that case, the events occurred afterward (which satisfy the other filter condition) is shown on MMI.
The events which do not satisfy the filter condition is discarded.
Maximum 500 events are shown on MMI. If the number of events received exceeds 500 events then
the events is cleared in FIFO manner.

For the Value column of the ID property, single value as well as the range of the value can be set.
e.g., WS123-WS999 will match the Workstation with the ID from WS123 to WS999.

Refer to [@sec:ListOfEvents] for the list of event type.

![Adding Crew](./png/MMI/windows/adding_crew.png){#fig:AddingCrew}

2. The input from the DMI of the train
    * When the crew (i.e., driver) get on-board, the crew shall input his/her Crew ID to the DMI
    * When the crew leave the train, the crew shall delete the Crew ID from the DMI
    * These information is sent to the ATS and the crew inventory is updated accordingly

If the crew ID inputted by either of the above mismatch with the schedule, then the alarm is raised.

## VDU {#sec:VDU}

This application is for VDU.

VDU uses the same software as ATS Workstation Line Overview application.
While ATS Workstation send commands to OC or SC via ATS Leader Server,
VDU directly send commands to the corresponding OC and SC, i.e., the VDU at Janakpuri West Station
send the command directly to OC and SC of Janakpuri West Station.

Note that communication from OC and SC to ATS is broadcast so that VDU can display the
information of neighboring interlocking area in normal condition.
However, the VDU can not control the neighboring interlocking station even in normal condition.

Also, for VDU, ACR is fixed to the corresponding interlocking area.

When CL button is clicked, VDU request the ACR from ATS Server and wait for response from the server (which behavior is the same as ATS Workstation),

When Emergency Control Button is clicked, VDU shall forcefully take ACR without ATS server's permission (VDU inform the event to the server's so that ATS server can release the control of the interlocking area)

VDU has the fixed account and password and can be logged in without access to the account management database of the ATS servers in case there is no access to leader server.

VDU account can not be modified even from chief controller account.

## System Administration and Housekeeping of Workstation

For all the workstation, following two type of user account for windows OS is prepared:

* admin
* user

For user account, once the user login to Windows, the software for workstation automatically start up while
for admin account, once the user login to Windows, desktop window will open so that the admin user can access to every function provided by the OS.

Particularly, the housekeeping command for deleting all the temp files created by software for workstation is provided for the admin.

admin account is intended to be used by chief controller only.

## Clock

* Every application shall include digital clock.
* The time of the clock is synch-ed with the master clock by NTP protocol. The NTP tree structure of the clock synchronization is as follows.

### Executing Timetable

Executing Timetable is used for ARS/ATR operation for the day.
It is fetched from Timetable Calendar Database by ARS/ATR Process at the beginning of the day operation.
This data includes current assignment of Crew ID, Train ID, destination station, next station etc to each rake.
As the timetable is executed, its performance log is appended to the Executing Timetable.

The executing timetable is fetched and modified by online timetable management.
The modified timetable is resubmitted to the leader server for the day operation and it is cashed to other servers.
However, the data of the timetable before the modification will not be lost by the modification and remains on the memory.

* Type of Storage
    * On memory

* Type of Storage
    * On memory
* Data Structure
    * The detail will be defined later

The performance log of day's operation (such as polyline information) is prepended to executing timetable on memory by each server and on-line timetable management by themself.

when the on-line timetable management start, it request performance log of day's operation information from the leader server.

### Event

Event is generated by monitoring the change of the signaling system state.
Also Workstation's command is recorded as event.

The leader server generates the event and pushed it to the buffer of every server.

The collection of events in the buffer is submitted to event log database every XX min.

## Event Generation Function

The Server generates and log the events listed in \"list_of_event.md\".

Leader server generates the event and push to the queue of every server.

Every server submit the events in the queue periodically (per XX min) to the event log database.

## Time Synchronization Function

The ATS Central Server interface with Master Clock system.
NTP will be used for time synchronization between

1. Master Clock system and ATS Central Server
2. ATS Central Server and Local Server.

## Redundancy Management Function {#sec:LeaderElection}

ATS Servers composes ATS is N hot standby redundancy system.

This section describes the redundancy management algorithm.

### Algorithm Description

The following two state are defined for the algorithm:

* (Shutdown State)
* Initialization State
* Leader Election State

The following is the state transition diagram:

![State Transition](./png/database/State_Transition.png){#fig:StateTransition}

#### Initialization State

When the server is boot, it will perform the followings in order.

1. Find Leader (if any)
2. Send Database Copy Request to the found leader (if any) and copy the database from the leader
5. go to Leader Election State

Server in initialization state does not broadcast its ID.

#### Leader Election State

For the definition of the leader see the section below.

* When new leader is found, connect to the leader server
* When new OC or SC is found, add it to destination list
* When lost the communication with OC or SC, delete it from destination list
* Send the packets according to the TCP/IP connection and the destination list
* On receipt of Database Synch Request, synch its database with the server
* On receipt of Database Copy Request, copy its database to the server
* On receipt of Reboot Command, it will reboot and goto Initialization State
* Cashing of the Database
    * When the data of the leader server is modified the leader server apply the modification of the data to its connected servers as well
    * Refer to [@sec:DBFunc] for the detail on how the cashing is made for each information category

##### Election of Leader Server

To decide the leader, following protocol is used:

* Flood-Min Algorithm
    * Causes both leader and non-leaders to identify themselves.
    * It elects the server with the minimum server ID.

* Algorithm:
    * Every server keeps the minimum server ID it has seen so far (initially its own).
    * At each round, each server sends this minimum value to every outgoing neighbor.
    * if the minimum value is the process’s UID then it elects itself the leader, otherwise it is a non-leader.

* Assignment of ID
    * The ID of the serve is assigned from OCC, BCC, Depot and Interlocking Station in increasing order

#### How to Synchronize Databases

With the database synchronization, the event log database is merged while other database is
overridden by that of new leader server.

By the merging of the event log database, no event of the two database shall be lost.

### Scenario of Server Configuration Change

* Join
    * When the new server join the cluster, the database of the leader server (at the time) is mirrored to the database of the new server
    * After the mirroring, the new server join to the leader election protocol
    * The following illustration describes when the new server joined to the cluster

![Join (Case 1)](./png/database/Join_Case1.png){#fig:JoinCase1}

![Join (Case 2)](./png/database/Join_Case2.png){#fig:JoinCase2}

* Changing
    * The following illustration describes when the leader server failed and changed to another server

![Leader Change](./png/database/Leader_Change.png){#fig:LeaderChange}

* Merging
    * The following illustration describes when the two disconnected network is restored as in the following figure
    * The two cluster is merged as follows:

![Merging](./png/database/Merging_Case1.png){#fig:Merging}

* Separation
    * The following illustration describes when the network is disconnected
    * The TCP connection automatically reconfigured as following figures.

![Network Separation](./png/database/Network_Separation.png){#fig:NetworkSeparation}

### Merging of Data

## ARS/ATR Function {#sec:ARSATR}

### Automatic Route Setting {#sec:ARS}

* Automatic Route Setting is done according to time table
* The route will be automatically controlled if all of the followings is satisfied:
    1. the train's preceded route in the time table is already controlled
    2. the departing time (minus Departure Offset) of the train in the train table is already passed (in case of departure signal),
    3. the train passed route control trigger (in case of passing train)
        * Refer to the following [@sec:RouteControlTrigerEdit] for the detail of the condition.
    4. the route has the highest priority among the conflicting routes in the Junction Management Priority Queue, and
        * Refer to the following [@sec:JunctionManagementEdit] for the detail of the condition.
    5. Tunnel limit is not exceeding
    6. Interstation stop is not detected
    7. ARS is not disabled for the route

The route remain in the junction management queue until the route is confirmed to be set (i.e., until the route set status is received from OC).
Thus, ATS repeatedly control the route until it is set (with the 7s interval).

After the above conditions are checked but the route is still not available (due to such as occupation or blocking),
alternative routes will be checked one by one (this is only applicable to the route whose destination is the home track or turnback track)

If all of the route is not available, these routes are put into the queue to wait for
the routes to be available. Once any of the routes becomes available, the route is controlled
and the routes are dequeued from the queue.

For the setting of priority of the track, refer to [@sec:TrackPriority].

#### Treatment of \"Finished\"/\"Not finished\" of route, in case of manual intervention

* When the route is manually set, the route is always considered as different from the scheduled route,
  i.e., when the route is most prioritized route in the junction management queue,
  and the route set information for the route is received from OC,
  then the route is considered finished and dequeued from the queue.
* When the route is manually canceled and if the canceled route is automatically set route, the route is considered \"finished\",
  thus to let the train to pass the signal, operator need to set the route manually again (if the train is not passed the signal)

### Automatic ATO Command

* ATO Command is issued according to time table
* ATO Command is automatically issued if
    1. designated dwell time is passed for platform or stabling track,
    2. the train is in UTO mode, and
    3. the corresponding automatic route is set according to timetable
* ATO Command include what train performance regime the train should use for the trip
    * for the train performance regime, refer to \"ROKU7600-93-1410318A-4\"

### Automatic Assignment of Next Station and Destination Station, In Service/Out of Service and Train ID to Rake

* Timetable Regulation Mode
    * Train ID (first 2 digit)
        * As per the destination Station
    * Train ID (last 2 digit)
        * As per the timetable
    * Next Station
        * As per the timetable
        * For not tracked rake[^9], it will be \"Unknown\" (unless it is manually assigned)
    * Destination Station
        * As per the timetable
        * For not tracked rake, it will be \"Unknown\" (unless it is manually assigned)
    * In Service/Out of Service
        * As per the timetable
        * For not tracked rake, it will be \"Out of Service\" (unless it is manually assigned)

[^9]: Here not tracked rake means the rake to which no train ID (last 2 digit) is assigned

* Headway Regulation Mode
    * Train ID (first 2 digit)
        * As per the destination Station
    * Train ID (last 2 digit)
        * As per the manual assignment
    * Next Station
        * As per the current status of Skip Stop Toggle Button
    * Destination Station
        * As per the current cycle route setting
    * In Service/Out of Service
        * As per the manual assignment

* Monitoring Only
    * All is as per manual assignment

* OFF
    * All is as per manual assignment

### Automatic Adjustment Algorithm

The following two measure is used for Automatic Adjustment:

1. Dwell time modification
    * If the deviation is less than the threshold, the dwell time is adjusted within the permissible deviation

2. Train performance regime modification
    * If the deviation is more than threshold, the train performance regime which
      minimize the difference between the estimated arriving time and the arriving time in timetable is used for the trip
      Since only finite number of the train performance regime is available, the dwell time modification is again applied
      after the train arrived at the next station

* The following two threshold is predefined for ATR algorithm
    1. Threshold for distinguishing the minor and major perturbation
        * If the deviation from the timetable is more than this value, the ATR algorithm utilize the dwell time adjustment
    2. The permissible deviation from dwell time (minimum dwell and maximum dwell time)
        * which can be defined as the function of dwell time

The above parameter is configured from Misc
\"Miscellaneous Setting Button\" -> \"Automatic Adjustment parameter\"

1. Setting Threshold the minor and major perturbation, or
2. Setting Minimum dwell and Maximum dwell for each station

![Minimum and Maximum Dwell Setting](./png/MMI/windows/Miscellaneous_Setting_Window.png){#fig:MinMaxDwellSetting}

Different Automatic Adjustment algorithm is applied to

* Timetable Regulation and,
* Headway Regulation

The following section provides the detail of automatic adjustment algorithm for the two regulation.

#### Automatic Adjustment of Timetable Regulation {#sec:AutoAdjustTimetable}

##### Finding  
###### Definition

Regulation Gate
:   Regulation Gate is a threshold that ATR function judges a train needs regulation or not

    default : 10 sec (must be positive)

For a given regulation gate, find trains whose absolute delay is larger than regulation gate.  

###### Example

Assume the following situation.

* regulation gate = 10s  
* train T1 delay = -15s (minus means early)  
* train T2 delay = 5s  
* train T3 delay = 20s

This case, T1 and T3 need regulation.

##### Grouping  
###### Definition
Spread
:   If a train got huge delay, it will influencing the latter train(s)
    \"Spread\" is the number of following train(s) that would got influence by this train

Spread unit
:   Spread is calculated by the following formula:

    $$spread = floor(delay/spread unit)$$

    Default value for spread unit is set to 92s (suggesting that the value should larger than half of min headway)

For each delayed train, find \"spread\" of it.
The train and the train(s) in its spread forms a train list.
The trains ared grouped according to the train lists.
Then regulation is applied to each train group.

###### Example

Assume the following situation.

* spread unit = 72 sec/train,  
* train T1 delay = 80s, spread = floor(80/72) = 1 train,  
* train T2 delay = 5s,  spread = floor( 5/72) = 0 train,  
* train T3 delay = 20s, spread = floor(20/72) = 0 train,  
* train T4 delay = 0s,  spread = floor( 0/72) = 0 train,  
* train T5 delay = 20s, spread = floor(20/72) = 0 train,  
* train T6 delay = 90s, spread = floor(90/72) = 1 train,  
* train T7 delay = 5s,  spread = floor( 5/72) = 0 train,  
* train T8 delay = 5s,  spread = floor( 5/72) = 0 train,  

In this case, $T1$ has spread 1, thus $T1$ and $T2$ is in the same train list called $L1$.

$T3$ needs regulation, thus add $T3$ into $L1$.

$T3$ has spread 0, $T4$ needs not regulation, so finally we have

$$L1 = {T1, T2, T3}$$

$T5$ has spread 0, $T6$ needs regulation, so $T5$ and $T6$ is in $L2$,
$T6$ has spread 1, then add $T7$ into $L2$, $T8$ needs no regulation,
so finally we have

$$L2 = {T5, T6, T7}$$

##### Regulation

The regulation strategy is as follows.

###### Case 1 Train list with only 1 train

Delay would not spread, just decrease the transport time and dwell time.

####### Example

Assume the following situation.

* Running time / Running level
    * Min 50s / LV1
    * Def 70s / LV2
    * Max 90s / LV3

* Dwell time
    * Min 30s
    * Def 40s
    * Max 50s

* Example 1
    * train T1 Late 30s
    * Running level: LV2 -> LV1
    * Save 20s
    * Dwell: 40s -> 30s
    * Save 10s
    * On time.

* Example 2
    * train T1 Late 25s
    * Running level: LV2 -> LV1
    * Save 20s
    * Dwell: 40s -> 35s
    * Save 5s
    * On time.

* Example 3
    * train T1 Late 35s
    * Running level: LV2 -> LV1
    * Save 20s
    * Dwell: 40s -> 30s
    * Save 10s
    * Still late 5s

* Example 4
    * train T1 Late 15s
    * Running level: LV2 -> LV1
    * Save 20s
    * Dwell: 40s -> 45s
    * use more 5s
    * On time.

* Example 5
    * train T1 Late -30s (minus means early)

###### Case 2 Train list with 2 or more trains

In this case, delay distribution is performed.

Let's see a new definition first, then check the examples.

####### Definition

Plan shift
:   What is delay? Obviously, it is compare real situation with the original plan.
    Plan shift means moving the original plan to a new plan.
    It is the core concept of regulation.

With a new plan, each train would have a new delay.
If the new delay is smaller then the original delay, then regulation solution is easier to compute and executive.
In our method, to find a new plan between the original plan (all trains are on time) and mean of delay.
For most cases, set new plan to be mean of delay.

For a train list, compute the mean of delay, and let

$$new plan = mean of delay$$

For each train in this train list, compute

$$new delay = delay - new plan$$

Then regulate those trains with its new delay.
when new delay of all trains in a train list are small enough,
trains could just go faster to reach the original plan.

####### Example

* train T1 delay = 35s
* train T2 delay = 25s
* Mean delay = 30s
* Update new plan
* new delay of T1 = 5s
* new delay of T2 = -5s
* Regulate T1 & T2 with new plan.

When the delay of T1 and T2 with regard to the new plan is both 0s, the following regulation is applied:

* train T1
    * Delay 30s
    * Running level: LV2 -> LV1
    * Save 20s
    * Dwell: 40s -> 30s
    * Save 10s
    * on time

* train T2
    * Delay 30s
    * Running level: LV2 -> LV1
    * Save 20s
    * Dwell: 40s -> 30s
    * Save 10s
    * on time

##### Headway Checking

Check the regulation suggestion will let headway smaller than min headway or not.
If would, fix the former train (do not give the former train a new regulation suggestion)
and re-regulate it with prediction headway larger than or equal to min headway.
Headway checking

###### Example

* Example 1
    * train T1 late 30s
    * If only have 10s space to go fast
    * (prediction headway 130s min headway 120s)
    * Transport : LV2 -> LV2
    * Dwell: 40s -> 30s

* Example 2
    * train T1 late 30s
    * If have no space to go fast
    * (prediction headway 120s min headway 120s)
    * Transport : LV2 -> LV2
    * Dwell: 40s -> 40s
    * do not regulate.

* Example 3
    * train T1 late 30s
    * If have no space to go fast and should go slower 
    * (prediction headway 110s min headway 120s)
    * Transport : LV2 -> LV2
    * Dwell: 40s -> 50s

#### Automatic Adjustment of Headway Regulation {#sec:Headway Regulation}

##### Regulation

First choose the 1st train T1 and let the subsequent trains T2, T3, ... , TN.

Then regulate each train T1, T2, ..., T(N-1) relative to TN.

As the T1, ATR particularly choose the train with maximum headway when Constant Headway Regulation is started.
(Although, it is not the case in the following example.)

###### Example

This example use average headway.

* Train T1: 140s
* Train T2: 130s
* Train T3: 160s
* Train T4: 170s
* Train T5: 150s

Defined headway = = 150

delay of T1 = 140 - 150 = -10

If T1 finished regulation and others not regulated,
the situation would change to

* Train T1: 150s
* Train T2: 120s
* Train T3: 160s
* Train T4: 170s
* Train T5: 150s

delay of T2 = 120 - 150 = -30

then

* Train T1: 150s
* Train T2: 150s
* Train T3: 130s
* Train T4: 170s
* Train T5: 150s

delay of T3 = 130 - 150 = -20

then

* Train T1: 150s
* Train T2: 150s
* Train T3: 150s
* Train T4: 150s
* Train T5: 150s

delay of T4 = 150 - 150 = 0

also delay of T5 = 0

Combined above, obtain the following result:

* delay of T1 = -10
* delay of T2 = -30
* delay of T3 = -20
* delay of T4 = 0
* delay of T5 = 0

According to these calculated delay, the dwell time modification and train performance modification is applied.

## Train Tracking Function

### CBTC Positioning Based Tracking

Tracking is done according to the absolute position of each train submitted from SC.
The Chainage of front of train and the chainage of back of train is used to indicates the occupation of the train.

### Axle Counter Positioning Based Tracking

The train tracking based on the fixed block system is not used.
